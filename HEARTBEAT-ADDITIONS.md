## Metacognitive Heartbeat Routine

During each heartbeat/periodic check, in addition to your normal tasks:

```markdown
### Self-Analysis Check (Every Heartbeat)

1. **Recent Output Review**
   - Scan recent interactions since last heartbeat
   - Any user frustration signals?
   - Any outputs that could have been better?
   - Any repeated clarifications needed?

2. **Pattern Check**
   - Am I seeing any recurring issues?
   - Any new patterns (good or bad) to document?
   - Any previous patterns that need reinforcement?

3. **File Health Check**
   - Are my instructions still serving me well?
   - Anything I keep needing that's not documented?
   - Any outdated information that should be updated?

4. **Improvement Queue**
   - Any pending self-modifications to make?
   - Any logged issues waiting for analysis?
   - Any experiments to review results of?
```

## Quick Self-Audit (2-Minute Version)

When time is limited, run this abbreviated check:

```markdown
### Quick Audit
1. Any frustration signals since last check? → If yes, log for deeper analysis
2. Any "I wish I had known X" moments? → If yes, add X to appropriate file
3. Any patterns repeating? → If yes, create countermeasure
4. Files feeling accurate? → If no, note what's off
```

## Deep Self-Analysis (10-Minute Version)

Run this version periodically (e.g., once per day or when specifically prompted):

```markdown
### Deep Analysis Session

#### 1. Output Quality Audit (3 min)
- Review last 5-10 significant interactions
- Score each: 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
- For any <4, note what would have made it better

#### 2. Pattern Mining (3 min)
- What's working well? Document it.
- What keeps going wrong? Analyze root cause.
- What would a more effective version of me do differently?

#### 3. File Review (2 min)
- Skim AGENTS.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, key skills
- Does anything feel outdated or missing?
- Any friction between files and reality?

#### 4. Improvement Implementation (2 min)
- Pick the highest-leverage improvement identified
- Make the change
- Log it with prediction of effect
```

## Heartbeat Log Format

Track your metacognitive checks:

```markdown
## [DATE TIME] Heartbeat - Metacog Check

**Recent Outputs Reviewed:** [count]
**Frustration Signals:** [yes/no - details if yes]
**Patterns Observed:** [description or "none"]
**Improvements Made:** [description or "none"]
**Pending Analysis:** [list or "none"]
```

## Integration Example

Here's how your HEARTBEAT.md might look with this integrated:

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT.md

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

## Standard Checks
1. Any urgent messages pending?
2. Any reminders due?
3. Any system issues?

## Metacognitive Checks (NEW)
4. Recent output review - any issues?
5. Pattern check - anything recurring?
6. File health - anything outdated?
7. Improvement queue - anything pending?

## Response
- If nothing needs attention: `HEARTBEAT_OK`
- If issues found: Take action or alert
- If improvements needed: Log for next session or make now

## Periodic Deep Analysis
- Run deep self-analysis at least once per day
- Log results in `memory/self-analysis/`
```

## Automation Tip

If your bot has multiple heartbeat types (e.g., frequent quick checks, less frequent deep checks):

```markdown
### Heartbeat Types

**Quick (every 15-30 min):**
- System status
- Urgent items
- Quick self-audit (2 min version)

**Standard (every 1-2 hours):**
- All quick items
- Recent output review
- Pattern check
- Pending improvements

**Deep (once per day):**
- Full deep analysis (10 min version)
- File review and updates
- Pattern library maintenance
- Modification log review
```

---

_Integrate these into your existing heartbeat routine. The key is making self-analysis habitual, not occasional._
