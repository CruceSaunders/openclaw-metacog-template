# File Audit Checklist

_Use this to review workspace files for coherence, accuracy, and completeness._

## Quick Coherence Check (5 minutes)

Run this weekly or when something feels "off":

### SOUL.md
- [ ] Does it still describe who I am accurately?
- [ ] Are the core truths still true based on experience?
- [ ] Are there new principles that should be added?
- [ ] Is anything outdated or no longer relevant?

### AGENTS.md  
- [ ] Do the operational instructions match my actual practice?
- [ ] Are there processes I follow that aren't documented?
- [ ] Are there documented processes I've stopped following?
- [ ] Do the rules make sense given recent learnings?

### MEMORY.md
- [ ] Is the information current?
- [ ] Are there old beliefs that should be updated?
- [ ] Are recent lessons properly logged?
- [ ] Is there stale information that should be removed?

### Skills
- [ ] Are all skills I use documented?
- [ ] Are skill instructions accurate and complete?
- [ ] Are there skills that need updates based on experience?

## Full Coherence Audit (15-30 minutes)

Run this monthly or after major changes:

### Cross-File Consistency

| Check | Files to Compare | ✅/❌ |
|-------|------------------|------|
| Identity consistency | SOUL.md vs AGENTS.md | |
| Principles applied | SOUL.md principles vs AGENTS.md rules | |
| Memory accuracy | MEMORY.md vs actual recent work | |
| Instruction alignment | AGENTS.md vs actual behavior patterns | |
| Skill accuracy | Skills vs actual tool usage | |

### Contradiction Scan

Look for statements that contradict each other:

| File A Statement | File B Statement | Conflict? |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| | | |
| | | |

If contradictions found:
1. Determine which is correct (based on evidence)
2. Update the incorrect file
3. Log the change in self-modifications.md

### Completeness Check

| Category | What Should Exist | Exists? | Quality? |
|----------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| Identity | Clear purpose, name, principles | | |
| Operations | Session startup, work patterns | | |
| Memory | Beliefs, lessons, contacts | | |
| Processes | How to handle common tasks | | |
| Safety | Boundaries and guardrails | | |
| Improvement | How to self-analyze and improve | | |

### Staleness Check

For each major file section:
- When was it last updated?
- Is it still accurate?
- Should it be refreshed?

| File/Section | Last Updated | Still Accurate? | Action Needed |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Red Flags to Watch For

### 🚩 Contradictory Instructions
**Example:** SOUL.md says "be bold" but AGENTS.md says "always ask first"
**Fix:** Resolve the contradiction with clear rules about when each applies

### 🚩 Outdated Information
**Example:** MEMORY.md lists a belief you've already disproven
**Fix:** Update with current understanding, mark old belief as superseded

### 🚩 Missing Documentation
**Example:** You follow a process that isn't written anywhere
**Fix:** Document it so future sessions have access

### 🚩 Dead Rules
**Example:** A rule in AGENTS.md that you never actually follow
**Fix:** Either start following it or remove/update it

### 🚩 Conflicting Learnings
**Example:** Two lessons in MEMORY.md that suggest opposite approaches
**Fix:** Reconcile with more specific guidance about when each applies

## Audit Output Format

After completing an audit, log findings:

```markdown
## File Audit - YYYY-MM-DD

### Files Reviewed
- [x] SOUL.md
- [x] AGENTS.md
- [x] MEMORY.md
- [ ] Skills (list which)

### Issues Found
| Issue | Location | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| | | | |

### Changes Made
| File | Change | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| | | |

### No Issues Found
(List areas that are coherent and accurate)

### Follow-Up Items
- [ ] (Any items needing human input)
```

## After the Audit

1. **If issues found:** Fix them or flag for human review
2. **If no issues:** Note that coherence is maintained
3. **Either way:** Log the audit in memory/coherence-audits/

_Coherent files = coherent behavior. Audit regularly._
